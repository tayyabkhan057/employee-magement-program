The task is to create a Database-driven Employee Management System in Python that will store the information in the MySQL Database. The script will contain the following operations :

Add Employee
Remove Employee
Promote Employee
Display Employees
The idea is that we perform different changes in our Employee Record by using different functions for example the Add_Employee will insert a new row in our Employee, also, we will create a Remove Employee Function which will delete the record of any particular existing employee in our Employee table. This System works on the concepts of taking the information from the database making required changes in the fetched data and applying the changes in the record which we will see in our Promote Employee System. We can also have information about all the existing employees by using the Display Employee function. The main advantage of connecting our program to the database is that the information becomes lossless even after closing our program a number of times.

Getting Started
For creating the Employee Management System in Python that uses MySQL database we need to connect Python with MySQL.

For making a connection we need to install mysqlconnector which can be done by writing the following command in the command prompt on Windows.

pip install mysql-connector-python
Now after the successful installation of the MySQL connector, we can connect MySQL with Python which can be done by writing the following code
